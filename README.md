campustide
==========

CampusTide was a project I coded from scratch in 2011 using PHP and the Smarty templating engine. 
The web site's purpose was to enable university organizations to post events that students could search for 
based on their school. After entering in their scholl name, a calendar would show up with all the events for that month,
along with a navigation bar to switch months.

The organizations had to the ability to sign up, post events, and edit/delete. There was also an admin conole, where
site adminitrators could add new schools, delete organizations, and edit/delete events.
