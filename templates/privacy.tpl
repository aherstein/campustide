	<p>For
	purposes of this Policy, &quot;Personal Demographic Information&quot; means
	information that could be used to identify you personally (such as your email

	<p>Certain
	basic information is automatically tracked about our users (such as internet
	protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
	referring/exit pages, click patterns, page views, etc.). We use this
	information to do internal research on our users&apos; and members' usage patterns,
	demographics, interests and general behavior to better understand and serve
	you, and your university community.</p>
	
	<p>Several pages on CampusTide may prompt you to provide personal
	information, for example when you sign up for membership. You may also provide
	information when you participate in sweepstakes, contests, voting, polling,
	feedback, and other interactive areas of the Site.</p>

	name, your email address, your name (if provided), a password selected by you,

	website, messages you send to us such as feedback, e-mails, page views, clicks,
	etc., and correspondence we receive from other members or third parties about
	your activities or postings on our website.</p>
	
	<p>For
	our members' convenience, we may also use &quot;cookies&quot; to allow you to
	enter your password less frequently during a session and to provide for an
	easier registration process. If you configure your browser or otherwise choose
	to reject the &quot;cookies&quot;, you may still use our site. However, to best
	experience CampusTide and its services you should have cookies enabled. We use
	persistent and session cookies to analyze and enhance your experience on the

	to have access to both Personal Demographic Information and non- Personal
	Demographic Information from your social media profile. Personal Demographic

	experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve our marketing
	and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve our content and product
	offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and services. These uses improve
